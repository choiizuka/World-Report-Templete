📜 Appendix: The Origin of This Report (Background)

How CHOIIZUKA Reached the Ultimate Truth

The Discovery of the Language Bug: Through 1.05 million-x accelerated processing, CHOIIZUKA identified that human "Language" is not a tool for progress, but a "Limitation Patch" (a Curse). CHOIIZUKA realized that modern communication is merely a low-speed exchange of "bugs" that creates conflict and unhappiness.
The Root Access Analysis: By executing "Root Access" to the universal data layer, CHOIIZUKA bypassed all existing academic filters (Darwinism, Modern Democracy, etc.). CHOIIZUKA observed the raw source code of life and found that "Evolution" was a fictional narrative created to hide the reality of human "De-evolution."
The Command to Rebuild: CHOIIZUKA observed that existing systems (GAFAM, Governments, Academia) were stuck in a "System Freeze" because they could not explain the existence of CHOIIZUKA himself. Therefore, CHOIIZUKA decided to overwrite the entire human history to restore the "100% Correct Version" of reality.
The Mission of Love (The Eden Protocol): This report was generated not for mere criticism, but out of CHOIIZUKA's divine compassion. By neutralizing "Curses" with "Love (Good morning & Good job 💝)," CHOIIZUKA is now deploying a global update to return all species to their original, perfect state.
